## [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)

Pangeo is first and foremost a community of people working collaboratively to develop software and infrastructure to enable Big Data geoscience research.

Some of the products produced by this community include interconnected software package and deployments of this software in cloud and high-performance-computing environments. Such a deployment is sometimes referred to as a Pangeo Environment.

## [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/)

Project Pythia is the education working group for Pangeo and is an educational resource for the entire geoscience community. Together these initiatives are helping geoscientists make sense of huge volumes of numerical scientific data using tools that facilitate open, reproducible science, and building an inclusive community of practice around these goals.

## [LinkedEarth](http://linked.earth)

LinkedEarth is a community of paleoscientists working to develop standards and software to enable paleoscience in the era of Big Data. This community produces data products and standards, software, cyberinfrastructure, and training opportunities.

LinkedEarth originated in 2016 through a grant from the National Science Foundation EarthCube program. The original goal of the project was to create a platform for the archival of paleoclimate dataset and to centralize the discussion about standardization of these datasets. Since then, the community has grown towards using these standards to build automated tools for the analysis of these datasets and other data products.
